> Each field of the form class map to the HTML form <input> elements and each one is a class itself, it manages form data and performs validation while submitting the form.

Steps for creating django forms
------
> In this example, we are implementing sample django forms using basic django model object.

##### Install DJango RestFramework / prerequisites
> install django (if django is not installed on your machine)
`pip install django`
> **OR**
> use this command for user specific installation 
`pip install django --user`

##### Project setupProject setupProject setupProject setup

> Create new django project called **employee_form**

```python
mkdir django_employee_form
cd django_employee_form
django-admin create employee_form
```
 > Create django app 

```python 
django-admin startapp webapp
```

##### Modify your django application settings.py
> Add 'webapp' into INSTALLED_APPS.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ....
    'webapp',
]
```
##### Implement DJango forms

> Define sample URLS on webapp/urls.py

```python
from django.urls import path, include
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('',views.index),
]
```
> Now sync your database for the first time & Create superuser for the first time

```python
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

> Create a model for Employee on webapp/models.py

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    salary = models.BigIntegerField()
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
> sync DB with changes

```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

> Add your **Employee** model into admin console. We can navigate and check the entries on db http://localhost:8000/admin

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Employee
admin.site.register(Employee)
```

> Create a file form.py and define ModelForm on it.
```python
from django import forms
from .models import Employee
class EmployeeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Employee
        fields = '__all__'
        # fields = ('id', 'name')
```

> Create index.html file on webapp/templates/index.html
 
 ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <title>Index</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<form method="POST" class="post-form">  
        {% csrf_token %}  
        {{ form.as_p }}  
        <button type="submit" class="save btn btn-default">Save</button>  
    </form>  
</body>  
</html>  
```

> Update views as per the ModelForms on webapp/views.py
 
 ```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.shortcuts import HttpResponse
from .forms import EmployeeForm
def index(request):
    emp = EmployeeForm()
    return render(request,"index.html",{'form':emp})  
```
> Now lets run the server *python manage.py runserver*
